              The human voice is one of the most important means of expressing raagdaari music. Unlike many instruments, the voice is capable of sliding between a wide range of notes using ghaseet and meend. Raagdaari vocal music also allows for the use of bandish, or poetry set to a melodic composition. When not singing words, singers also sing in aakar, using the syllable, “ah”, as a vehicle for melodic development and exploration. Normally, people sing in the same key for their entire raagdaari music career; for men, this is usually C, C# or D, while women commonly choose to sing in F, F# or G.

             The sitar is a string instrument in the lute family, which evolved to its present form in the 18th century. This instrument has a long, wide neck, a pear-shaped body made of a gourd, and sometimes has an additional, detachable resonating gourd, held under the tuning pegs at the top of the neck. The sitar has 20 moveable frets, 5 melody strings, 2 drone strings, or chikari, to accent the rhythm or pulse, and up to 13 sympathetic strings beneath the frets, which are tuned according to which raag is being played. The musician plucks the strings with a wire plectrum worn on the index finger of the right hand, while the left index and middle fingers manipulate the strings with subtle pressure on or between the frets and with sideways pulls of the strings. The sitar has become the most widely-known instrument in the South-Asian lute family, and was popularized to western audiences in the 1960’s by Ravi Shankar and The Beatles.

              The harmonium, or pump organ, is a keyboard instrument that produces a sound by pushing air through a series of reeds. It usually has a range of about 3 octaves, and is often used by singers or a guru’s student to accompany the melodic movement of the voice. By playing the same melody that the musician is singing in real time, the singer can match their voice’s pitch to that of the harmonium to ensure that the notes are in tune. This also provides the student with valuable listening practice and insight into the nature of the raag.

             The sarod is widely believed to have descended from the Afghan rubab and the ancient chitra veena. It usually has 17 to 25 strings, depending on the gharana, or school of music to which the performer belongs. Like the sitar, 2 of these strings are chikari strings, 4 are jod strings, or melodic strings, and the rest are tarab, or sympathetic strings. The jod strings are tuned to Ma, Sa, lower Pa, and lower Sa, while the chikari strings are tuned to upper Sa. However unlike the sitar, the sarod does not have frets; the musician can slide their fingers up and down the neck to produce a continuous melodic ascent or descent, creating ghaseet and meend.

              The surbahar, or sometimes known as a “bass sitar”, is a plucked string instrument also in the South-Asian lute family. This instrument is tuned 2 to 5 steps lower than a sitar, and has 3-4 chikari strings, 4 melodic strings and 10 or 11 sympathetic strings, which are below the moveable frets, similar to the sitar. Since the surbahar is pitched lower than a sitar, it is also a larger instrument, and the performer is able to glide up to an octave above the original note at each fret, by bending the string laterally.

              The esraj, a descendent of the ancient dilruba, is a bowed string instrument which evolved to its current form in the 18th century. The esraj has a neck similar to that of the sitar, with 17-19 rounded moveable frets that are elevated above 12-15 sympathetic strings. This instrument usually has 4 melodic strings that are played with a bow, or gaj. Rather than bending the strings like on a sitar, the musician can create ghaseet and meend by sliding their fingers up and down the strings while bowing them.

              The veena is an ancient small, plucked string instrument, which over time has evolved into various forms of lutes, zithers, and arched harps. Similar to the modern sitar, the veena has two resonating gourds at each end, and has 4 strings for playing melody, and 3 drone strings. The musician usually wears a metal plectrum around the first and second fingers of their dominant hand to strum the melody strings downward, while playing the drone strings with the pinky finger. The veena has a range of 3 octaves, and unlike the sitar, the 24 frets are all not moveable, and are lined up chromatically in half steps.

              The tanpura is a long-necked, plucked string instrument which functions as a drone, providing a constant tonic note throughout a performance on top of which the featured musician creates melodies. The size of the tanpura varies depending on which instrument it is accompanying, and the tuning of its four overtone-rich strings can also vary, depending on which raag is being performed. Its most common tuning of its four strings is lower Pa-middle Sa-middle Sa-upper Sa. However, if the tanpura is accompanying a musician who is performing a raag that omits Pa, the lowest string may be tuned down to Ma. Less commonly, some raags call for the lowest string string to be tuned to Dha or Ni. The tanpura player does not change the pitch of the strings while playing the tanpura; rather, all strings are played as open strings, and the light, constant strumming pattern remains constant throughout the entire performance of a raag. Nowadays, it is common for musicians to practice or even perform with an electronic tanpura box that produces an artificial drone sound out of convenience, as it does not go out of tune or require another person to operate.

The tanpura player does not change the pitch of the strings while playing the tanpura; rather, all strings are played as open strings, and the light, constant strumming pattern remains constant throughout the entire performance of a raag. Nowadays, it is common for musicians to practice or even perform with an electronic tanpura box that produces an artificial drone sound out of convenience, as it does not go out of tune or require another person to operate.

              The tanpura is a long-necked, plucked string instrument which functions as a drone, providing a constant tonic note throughout a performance on top of which the featured musician creates melodies. The size of the tanpura varies depending on which instrument it is accompanying, and the tuning of its four overtone-rich strings can also vary, depending on which raag is being performed. Its most common tuning of its four strings is lower Pa-middle Sa-middle Sa-upper Sa. However, if the tanpura is accompanying a musician who is performing a raag that omits Pa, the lowest string may be tuned down to Ma. Less commonly, some raags call for the lowest string string to be tuned to Dha or Ni.

             Although the violin is originally a western instrument, it has become common in the Hindustani music canon. Because there are no frets, the musician can slide their fingers up and down the neck while holding down and bowing the strings, producing ghaseet and meend- an essential element of raagdaari music. While the instrument’s construction, its tuning and means of sound production are the same in western music as in raagdaari music, the playing technique is much different in the latter. The performer holds the instrument lower than common practice in western music, with its head stock pointed towards the ground, and the base does not always touch the chin. The violin’s versatility has expanded to modern raagdaari music because its beautiful and assertive sound and its lack of frets make it just as capable of expressing the grammatic and melodic structure of a raag as any other traditional Hindustani instrument.

              The pakhavaj is another percussion instrument used to maintain the laya in raagdaari music. Although it is now less common than the tabla, it is much older- historians believe it originated in the 14th century AD, and is a descendent of the mridang. The pakhavaj is a single drum with drum heads on each opposing end. The bigger drum head is played with an open palm and produces a low, overtone-rich sound. The treble end is smaller and thus produces a higher tone with the drummer’s palm, while certain fingers are placed on different parts of the drum skin. Like the tabla, this also produces bols, or specific sounds verbalized with mnemonic devices, which fall on certain beats within the taal, or rhythmic cycle.

             The tabla is the most common percussion instrument used in Hindustani music, and consists of a pair of drums, one bigger than the other. The daya is the smaller of the 2 drums, is played by the performer’s dominant hand, and is about 15 cm in diameter and 25 cm tall. The baya is the bigger of the two drums, is played by the performer’s non-dominant hand, and is about 20 cm in diameter and 25 cm tall. The playing technique involves producing a wide variety of specific sounds with different parts of the fingers and palms on different parts of each drum head, reflected in mnemonic syllables, or bols. In raagdaari music, different rhythmic cycles call for different bols being placed on its corresponding beat, or maatra, and advanced musicians may improvise around these patterns.
