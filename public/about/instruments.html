              The human voice is one of the most important means of expressing raagdaari music. Unlike many instruments, the voice is capable of sliding between a wide range of notes using ghaseet and meend. Raagdaari vocal music also allows for the use of bandish, or poetry set to a melodic composition. When not singing words, singers also sing in aakar, using the syllable, “ah”, as a vehicle for melodic development and exploration. Normally, people sing in the same key for their entire raagdaari music career; for men, this is usually C, C# or D, while women commonly choose to sing in F, F# or G.

              The harmonium, or pump organ, is a keyboard instrument that produces a sound by pushing air through a series of reeds. It usually has a range of about 3 octaves, and is often used by singers or a guru’s student to accompany the melodic movement of the voice. By playing the same melody that the musician is singing in real time, the singer can match their voice’s pitch to that of the harmonium to ensure that the notes are in tune. This also provides the student with valuable listening practice and insight into the nature of the raag.

              The esraj, a descendent of the ancient dilruba, is a bowed string instrument which evolved to its current form in the 18th century. The esraj has a neck similar to that of the sitar, with 17-19 rounded moveable frets that are elevated above 12-15 sympathetic strings. This instrument usually has 4 melodic strings that are played with a bow, or gaj. Rather than bending the strings like on a sitar, the musician can create ghaseet and meend by sliding their fingers up and down the strings while bowing them.

              The veena is an ancient small, plucked string instrument, which over time has evolved into various forms of lutes, zithers, and arched harps. Similar to the modern sitar, the veena has two resonating gourds at each end, and has 4 strings for playing melody, and 3 drone strings. The musician usually wears a metal plectrum around the first and second fingers of their dominant hand to strum the melody strings downward, while playing the drone strings with the pinky finger. The veena has a range of 3 octaves, and unlike the sitar, the 24 frets are all not moveable, and are lined up chromatically in half steps.

              The tanpura is a long-necked, plucked string instrument which functions as a drone, providing a constant tonic note throughout a performance on top of which the featured musician creates melodies. The size of the tanpura varies depending on which instrument it is accompanying, and the tuning of its four overtone-rich strings can also vary, depending on which raag is being performed. Its most common tuning of its four strings is lower Pa-middle Sa-middle Sa-upper Sa. However, if the tanpura is accompanying a musician who is performing a raag that omits Pa, the lowest string may be tuned down to Ma. Less commonly, some raags call for the lowest string string to be tuned to Dha or Ni. The tanpura player does not change the pitch of the strings while playing the tanpura; rather, all strings are played as open strings, and the light, constant strumming pattern remains constant throughout the entire performance of a raag. Nowadays, it is common for musicians to practice or even perform with an electronic tanpura box that produces an artificial drone sound out of convenience, as it does not go out of tune or require another person to operate.

              The tanpura is a long-necked, plucked string instrument which functions as a drone, providing a constant tonic note throughout a performance on top of which the featured musician creates melodies. The size of the tanpura varies depending on which instrument it is accompanying, and the tuning of its four overtone-rich strings can also vary, depending on which raag is being performed. Its most common tuning of its four strings is lower Pa-middle Sa-middle Sa-upper Sa. However, if the tanpura is accompanying a musician who is performing a raag that omits Pa, the lowest string may be tuned down to Ma. Less commonly, some raags call for the lowest string string to be tuned to Dha or Ni. The tanpura player does not change the pitch of the strings while playing the tanpura; rather, all strings are played as open strings, and the light, constant strumming pattern remains constant throughout the entire performance of a raag. Nowadays, it is common for musicians to practice or even perform with an electronic tanpura box that produces an artificial drone sound out of convenience, as it does not go out of tune or require another person to operate.
