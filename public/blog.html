      <h3>
        Chalan and the Unpredictability of Life
      </h3>

      <p>
      Swar is to theharao (stability of the voice) as Raag is to chalan (movement from one note to the next note; the basic phrases of a raag’s constitution). Further, every raag has a typical and unique chalan or style of movement. A raag has a few particular notes which are held as the dominant, distinctive notes of the raag; however, emphasizing the featured notes alone are not enough to uphold a raag’s identity. Additionally, the unique movement between the notes, or chalan, goes further to illuminate the raag’s particular mood, thus identifying its distinct nature.
      </p>

      <p>
      Equally important to the presentation of a raag is the value of its human element. Music is a performing art and performing happens through a living person, at a given place and time. Human life moves between two realms of planning and destiny! Even if we plan our life so accurately and painstakingly, the element of unpredictability is always there! So when it comes to performance – may it be performing our work or our art- there is always a struggle between our cultivated skill and the unpredictable element of luck and chance. Sometimes they both work in cooperation, but many times they may compete and conflict with one another! 
      </p>

      <p>
      As far as the performance of music is concerned, we do experience this dual aspect of building our skill through practice, or riyaz, and experiencing unexpected spontaneous turns in our performance. So it is essential to have enough mastery over the “chalan” of the raag to become rooted in performance. By mastering the chalan, we can demonstrate our skill and do justice to the raag, without being pulled off track by the possible unpredictable elements that may arise in performance.
      </p>

      <p>
      Thus, even though both the life and performance are unmanageable and unpredictable, we could become successful –at least to some extent- in singing. It is a balancing act between the planning.

    <h3>Raag Personalities</h3>
    <p>
      The word “Raag” is a Sanskrit word that literally translates “Love”. But somehow its conventional meaning transformed to “mood”, or “atmosphere”. So, in Hindustani music “Raag” means a melodious scheme of a set of specific some notes which creates a particular mood or atmosphere. Notes and scales have their own appeal to human ears, but a “Raag” goes one step further. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The notes are independent entities when they are in the Saptak. But the moment they enter the “Raag” those notes start to caress each other, embrace each other and even melt into each other; it is really a natural miracle. The “ghaseet” (ascending gliding movemnent) and “meend” (descending gliding movement) are the two ways through which the notes melt into each other. And this melting creates a divine intoxication or an ecstasy that elevates the listeners to become mesmerized and start swinging their bodies like drunkards!
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a few raags whose temp is a little fast, like raag Naand or Adaanaa, etc. Their “personality” is rather like a dancing peacock. There are some other raags whose tempo is medium and they move rather smoothly, like raag “Jaijaivanti”, or “Baageshri”. Their personality is like a just-married woman having a dignified dance. And lastly, there are very special raags, whose movement is damn slow and are like an emperor in a golden long robe moving very slowly accepting the salutes of the people with a graceful nod of their chin! Such raags include Darbaari Kaanadaa, Miya Malhaar, Puriyaa, etc.
      Raags do have “personalities”, which are indicative of their unique style of melodic movement. For example, Raag Bhoopali has a personality of a devotee in a temple. Raag Yaman’s personality evokes a religious celebration, while Raag Bihag has a personality of soft romance of young people.
